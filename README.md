# SpaceWeather-Monitoring
Built a deep learning-based forecasting model to predict solar flare activity using historical space weather datasets including solar wind and sunspot activity. The project leverages LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to capture temporal patterns in time-series data.
